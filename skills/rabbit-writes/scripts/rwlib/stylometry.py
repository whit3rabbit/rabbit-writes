A voice as a measurable target: the fingerprint, and the distance to it.

Everything the voice band enforces today is a refusal: a banned word, a
punctuation rule, a paragraph cap. A document can clear all of them and sound
like nobody, which SKILL.md admits in prose and nothing measures. This module
is the measurement. It answers "how far is this document from how this person
writes" with a number whose calibrated range comes from the person's own
samples, so "in the voice" stops being a feeling and becomes a band.

The measure is Burrows' Delta, the standard authorship-attribution distance:
the document's function-word rates, z-scored against the author's baseline,
averaged. Function words carry the signal on purpose. Content words are about
the topic, and a voice has to survive a change of topic. "also" versus
"additionally", the contraction rate, and how often a sentence opens with
"but" are the connective tissue where a generic register creeps back in, and
they are exactly what no ban list reaches.

Two departures from textbook Delta, both forced by the data this runs on:

  A fixed marker list, not the corpus top-N. Delta classically takes the most
  frequent words of a large reference corpus. Three writing samples do not
  have a stable top-N: one essay about markets puts "market" in it. The list
  below is fixed, versioned, and English-only, like every other calibration
  in this engine.

  A floored standard deviation. Three samples give a noisy sd, and a marker
  the author uses at an identical rate in every sample gives sd 0, at which
  point any deviation divides to infinity. Each marker's sd is floored at a
  fraction of its mean and at an absolute minimum, so a marker the author
  never uses can still register a deviation without one "moreover" scoring as
  an infinite departure. The floors are stated as constants, not buried.

What a distance is, and is not. It is a signal about register, reported at P2
and never enforced: a writer is allowed to sound unlike themselves on purpose,
and a number that blocked a commit over it would be the humanizer-shaped
failure this plugin exists to avoid. It is also not an authorship verdict, for
every reason references/false-positives.md gives. The finding it feeds says
"further from the profile than any of the samples are from each other", quotes
the markers responsible, and stops there.

The per-marker contributors are the half that makes it actionable. A bare
distance tells a rewrite loop nothing. "additionally at 3.1 sd over the
profile, so at 2.4 sd under" tells it which words to trade.

Two blocks, not one. The markers answer "does this sound like them". The
`measures` block answers "is it built the same way", and it carries min and max
as well as a mean, because the writer's own envelope is what says a converted
document has overshot into caricature. The sentence shape is the distribution
behind `avg_sentence_words`, stored as deciles, and it is a rewrite target
rather than a threshold: nothing in scan.py raises a finding off it.

Neither of those is measured here. They come out of `scan.compute_stats`, and
scan.py imports this module, so the caller passes the numbers in. That is the
same inversion `distributions(..., split_sentences=None)` already uses.

**Callers pass prose with the markup already stripped.** `scan.strip_for_stats`
is that function, and both call sites in this plugin run it first. A fingerprint
built over raw markdown and compared against stripped prose would be measuring
two different things, and the difference would read as a register change: a
code fence has no function words in it at all.

    "0.9, where this writer's own samples sit between 0.5 and 0.8 of each
