The pattern catalogue, loaded once and shared.

scan.py scores against it, verify.py gates against it, and PROOF.md publishes
numbers measured against it. Those three only mean the same thing if they read
the same file, and "measured against lexicon 3" is only checkable if the file
says which version it is. `version` is that field, echoed into scan's --json
output and into PROOF.md's header.
