"""
Shape rules for thesaurus.json, in the one place its three consumers share.

`scripts/validate.py` checks the shipped file, `04_merge_accepted.py` in the
research pipeline checks a merged object before writing it, and the skill's
own `tests/test_thesaurus.py` checks it on a checkout where the repo validator
does not exist. Three restatements of one constraint set is how a merge script
and a validator come to disagree about what valid means, which is the drift
`rwlib.voice_check` already exists to prevent for voice profiles.

Each rule exists because breaking it is a silent failure downstream: a reach
word that is not a mechanical substitution gets skipped by fixes.py's
`is_mechanical_substitution`, an overreach term in two families produces two
competing rewrites of one word, and a reach word that is also somebody's
overreach term rewrites toward a word the next family is busy rewriting away.

Stdlib only, 3.9+.
