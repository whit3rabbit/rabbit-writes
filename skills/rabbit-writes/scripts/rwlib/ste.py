STE: ASD-STE100 Issue 9 (2025-01-15) structural rules for scan.py.

This is a REPORT-ONLY layer. Unlike the lexicon tier system, which can
mechanically fix some violations (hidden characters, utm params, preferred
substitutions), STE violations almost always require judgment to rewrite.
The rewrite (re-splitting long sentences, reordering condition-before-command)
is a language model task. This module flags.

Two modes (from STE, not this module):
  - procedural   instructions: max 20 words/sentence
  - descriptive  explanations: max 25 words/sentence

**This module takes prose with the markup already stripped.** scan.py passes
the exempted copy it already built (`apply_exemptions`), so fenced code,
inline code spans, and quoted examples arrive blanked and are never flagged.
Called on raw markdown, every semicolon in a code fence reads as prose, which
is exactly the 1,069 false positives the first calibration run found. The
same contract `rwlib/stylometry.py` states for the same reason.

The lexicon (`scripts/ste_lexicon.json`) loads lazily, on the first check,
not at import: this module is imported by scan.py unconditionally, and an
eager load made every vendored copy of the engine unimportable when one
packaging list forgot the JSON. Lazy keeps `--help` and every import working
without it, but the mechanical band is default-on now and reads the file for
its caps, so a missing lexicon fails the *scan* rather than only `--ste`.
`scripts/package_skills.py` ships it in SHARED_ENGINE_FILES for that reason.

Synthetic finding IDs, raised by this engine only:
  ste-sentence-procedural    sentence over 20 words in procedural text
  ste-sentence-descriptive   sentence over 25 words in descriptive text
  ste-paragraph-sentences    paragraph over six sentences (Rule 6.6)
  ste-modal                  banned modal verb (should/would/may/might/could)
  ste-ing-verb               -ing form opening a clause after a comma
  ste-condition-order        condition clause after the command verb
  ste-banned-verb            banned verb (check/verify/confirm/ensure)
  ste-phrasal-verb           phrasal verb that should be one word
  ste-no-punctuation         semicolon (STE bans semicolons)
  ste-passive                passive voice where active is possible
  ste-vocab                  banned vocabulary item

The ids split into two bands, and the split is the point: what a script
counts exactly (sentence words, sentences per paragraph, semicolons,
condition order) runs in every plain scan, because counting is the one
thing a script does better than a model. What the lexicon suggests
(vocabulary, verb forms, modals) is advisory, P2, and only asked for.
`MECHANICAL_IDS` below is the one home for which is which.

The `suppression-*` ids are deliberately absent: rwlib/lexicon.py owns them,
and a second copy here is a drift surface. STE findings pass through the same
suppression pass as everything else because scan.py appends them before it
runs `suppress.apply`.

Stdlib only, 3.9+.
