learn_edits.py - what the user's corrections say about their profile.

`voice-setup`'s adjust mode is three sentences of procedure and no tooling: ask
what read wrong, find the rule that produced it, change that rule. It works and
it runs on recall, which means it runs at the worst possible moment. A person
who has just rewritten your output can tell you the word they hated. A week
later they remember that something felt off.

This reads the diff instead. Given what the skill produced and what the person
turned it into, it proposes profile changes with the count behind each one:

    python3 learn_edits.py converted.md their-edit.md
    python3 learn_edits.py converted.md their-edit.md --voice whit3rabbit
    python3 learn_edits.py converted.md their-edit.md --json

**Nothing here is written.** Every line is a suggestion a person confirms, the
same contract measure_voice.py holds itself to, and for a stronger reason: a
profile is a claim about somebody, and one edit is one edit. A word they
replaced once because it was wrong in that sentence is not a ban. The threshold
below is what separates the two, and it is deliberately not 1.

What it looks for, in the order it is worth acting on:

  substitutions   a word consistently traded for another. The strongest signal
                  a diff carries, and it maps straight onto
                  `preferred_substitutions` and often onto `banned_words`.
  removals        a word or phrase they took out and never put back.
  openers         sentence openers they cut, which is where a register lives
                  and what no ban list reaches.
  mechanics       punctuation the edit removed entirely, which is a `mechanics`
                  answer rather than a word.
  measures        how their edit moved the six stylometrics, against the
                  profile's own fingerprint when there is one. This is the half
                  that says the profile's *numbers* were wrong rather than its
                  word list.

Exit codes: 0 always when both files read, 2 on an IO error. This proposes and
never judges, so there is nothing for it to fail.
