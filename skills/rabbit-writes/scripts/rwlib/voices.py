Voice rules files, with inheritance.

Blending interpolates two whole profiles, which answers the question "what does
the average of these two people sound like". The commoner real need is smaller
and sharper: my voice, plus a few things this particular repo or client does
differently. `.rabbit-voice` already pins which profile a repo uses. This is the
other half, the per-repo delta:

    {
      "voice": "whit3rabbit-acme",
      "extends": "whit3rabbit",
      "banned_words": ["synergy"],
      "mechanics": {"oxford_comma": "require"}
    }

The merge rule is deliberately lopsided.

  bans      union. A child adds to what the parent forbids and cannot quietly
            drop one, because a house style that silently unbans a word is a
            house style nobody can rely on. To soften an inherited rule, give
            the child a `banned_regex` entry with the same id: entries merge by
            id and the child's wins outright, so it can lower a priority, widen
            a `max_allowed`, or point the pattern at something narrower.
  mechanics child wins, key by key. Parent keys the child does not mention
            survive, so an override file stays two lines long.
  scalars   child wins. `voice`, `default_priority`, and anything else.

Cycles are caught rather than recursed into, and a missing parent is an error
rather than a silent fall back to no rules at all: a profile that inherits from
nothing enforces nothing, and reporting a clean voice band on a document nobody
checked is the failure mode this whole file exists to avoid.

    decides, and when neither exists this resolves nothing. Nothing here knows
    or prefers a particular person.

    **A profile nobody chose is never enforced.** This used to fall back to the
    one profile sitting in `voices/`, with a note saying so. The plugin ships
    exactly one, an example, so on a fresh install that fallback was a stranger's

    `target_path` is the document being checked, if there is one: a repo's pin
    sits beside its files, so the document's own directory is searched before

    and the file being scanned usually does not, so the old exact-directory
    match found the pin only when the two happened to coincide. The nearest pin
    wins, and it is named in the note, because "which profile" and "who said
    so" are one answer.

    This used to live in readme_check.py and scan.py had none of it, so the two
