"""
SARIF 2.1.0 output, so findings land on the diff instead of in a CI log.

An audit tool wants to live inline on the pull request, next to the line it is
talking about. GitHub's `codeql-action/upload-sarif` puts it there, and the
finding shape in rwlib.findings maps onto SARIF without inventing anything:

    id        -> ruleId
    priority  -> level          P0 error, P1 warning, P2 note
    line      -> region.startLine
    label     -> message.text, with the excerpt as the second line
    band      -> a rule property, and a tag, so a reviewer can filter on it

Levels are a judgement call worth stating: P0 maps to `error` because a P0 is
what makes a reader bounce or a credential leak into a document, and GitHub
surfaces errors as blocking annotations. P1 and P2 are advisory and must not
be, or people turn the whole thing off.

Nothing here decides anything. It reformats a list of findings that some other
module already produced, which is why it is safe for it to know nothing about
prose.

Stdlib only, 3.9+.
