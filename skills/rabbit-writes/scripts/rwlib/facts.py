"""
The facts a paraphrase corrupts silently: numbers, dates, and quotations.

SKILL.md's first guardrail is "never invent facts", and until this module it was
prompt-only. `verify.py` proved a rewrite had not touched a code fence or a
table and said nothing about the sentence that turned 3,200 into 3,000. Numbers
and dates are exactly where a paraphrase goes wrong without looking wrong, and
they are the cheap half to check.

**Everything here canonicalizes before it compares.** That is the whole design.
A conversion under a `date_format: dmy` profile is *instructed* to rewrite
"September 12, 2025" as "12 September 2025", and a checker that reported it
would be failing the edit the skill asked for. So a date compares as its ISO
form, a percent compares the same whether it is spelled or signed, a range is
one token rather than two numbers, and a version is an identifier rather than
three. Each carve-out was sized against the 100-README corpus before it was
written, and the size is in the comment beside it.

Extraction is ordered and each pass eats its span, so nothing is counted twice.
Dates go first and are consumed without being emitted here, because `dates()`
owns them: left in, "September 12, 2025" would also contribute 12 and 2025 to
the number multiset, and reformatting the date would read as two numbers
changing.

The two directions are not symmetric, and that is a decision rather than an
oversight. A number in the source and missing from the rewrite is a fact that
left the document. A number in the rewrite and not in the source usually is not
an invention: a rewrite that turns "the last two years" into "2024 and 2025" is
deriving a number the source carried. Both are reported. Only the first fails,
and `verify.py` is where that is enforced.

Spelled numbers are not tracked at all. "three" against "3" is a style edit a
profile can legitimately require in either direction, and matching them would
turn this into a second lexicon. That is the known residual and it is
documented rather than papered over.

Named entities are here and are report-only, forever. A capitalized-run regex
cannot tell a product name from the first word of a sentence, and set-equality
on it would fail every rewrite that splits a sentence at a capital. What it is
good for is a list a person reads, which is why nothing in this plugin gates on
it.

The date patterns used to live in scan.py. They moved here because verify.py
needs them and must not import scan.py, which lazily imports verify. scan.py
keeps its own names as aliases onto these, the way it already aliases
`TABLE_RX` onto `rwlib.markdown.TABLE_ROW_RX`.

Every non-ASCII character in this file is written as an escape, never as a
literal. A curly apostrophe and an en dash both survive a copy and both are
silently rewritten by anything that normalizes the source, at which point the
alternative they sit in stops matching and the line still looks correct.
