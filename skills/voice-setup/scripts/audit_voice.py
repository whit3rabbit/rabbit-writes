audit_voice.py - does a profile survive the prose it was built from.

`build_voice.py --check` proves a rule fires on a probe sentence written for
it. The other half of validation is the inverse: run the finished profile over
the writer's own corpus and see which rules fire on the prose they came from.
A ban that trips the writer's own sentences is one of two things, and only the
writer can say which: a rule that is too broad, or a variant register the
profile has not accounted for. Until now that half was a procedure in SKILL.md
and a hand-run scan. This is the script for it.

    python3 audit_voice.py john sample1.md sample2.md sample3.md
    python3 audit_voice.py voices/dana.rules.json docs/dana/*.md --register formal
    python3 audit_voice.py john samples/*.md --json

Exactly one `scan.scan()` call per sample supplies everything: the voice-band
findings (fire-backs), the engine's own P0 tells, the fingerprint distance in
`stats["voice_distance"]`, and the numbers the cap suggestions are measured
from. There is no second measurement path here, because a second one drifting
from the first is the bug `rwlib` exists to end.

What it judges, and what it merely reports:

  fire-backs       a profile rule firing on the writer's own prose. The only
                   judgment: exit 1. `voice-distance` is exempt because it is a
                   measurement, not a rule, and `voice-oxford-comma` is exempt
                   because the engine itself holds it at P2 on the ground that
                   no regex can settle a serial comma.
  distance         per-sample distance from the fingerprint band. A note. An
                   out-of-range sample is a different register, not a broken
                   rule, and the suggestion is a per-register fingerprint
                   rather than a wider band.
  shape            per-sample sentence medians. A note. A wide spread means
                   the corpus holds two registers and the fingerprint is the
                   average of two people, which is nobody.
  known tells      engine P0 patterns over the corpus, which over one writer
                   are usually false positives ("of course," flagged as a
                   chatbot artifact over a writer who leans on the phrase).
                   Reported as candidates for the profile's
                   `## Known contamination` section. Never exit-affecting, and
                   the `safety` band is excluded: that band is unsuppressible
                   by design, so a concealed injection is never a tell to
                   record as somebody's habit.
  caricature       where a sample out-writers the writer: measures past the
                   profile's own envelope in the profile's own direction.
                   `stylometry.caricature` is calibrated in `PROOF.md` and
                   this is its first caller. A note.

**Nothing here is written.** Every suggestion carries its count, the same
contract `learn_edits.py` holds, and for the same reason: a profile is a claim
about somebody, and their own prose disagreeing with it is the disagreement
surfacing, not a bug in the scan.

Two limits worth knowing before reading a report. Samples that built the
fingerprint read in-range by construction, because the band is calibrated off
those same samples: the distance half is really testing held-out corpus. And
pass whole documents, not chunks: `max_allowed`, paragraph caps, and rate caps
are per-document rules, and a corpus of split chunks dilutes every ceiling
while drifting under the 250-word reliability floor.

Exit codes: 0 no rule fired on the writer's own prose, 1 at least one did,
2 on a usage or IO error.
