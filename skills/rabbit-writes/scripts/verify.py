"""
verify.py - preservation validator for a rewrite.

SKILL.md promises the editor will not touch code blocks, frontmatter, tables,
block quotes, inline code, URLs, file paths, or heading structure, and will not
add em dashes or leave a draft with more tells than it started with. Edit mode
writes to files, so a broken promise there is silent and destructive. This is
what checks them.

Two of those checks are narrower than the promise, and those narrowings are
measured rather than assumed. A file path is tracked only when it carries an
extension, for the reason spelled out at PATH_RX. Headings are ATX-only (`# Title`),
matching `rwlib.markdown.HEADING_RX`.

Image *sources* are checked, as of the pass that measured them. They used to be
covered only incidentally, by URL_RX when the src is absolute and by PATH_RX
when it is relative and carries an extension, so a relative extensionless src
was unprotected. See uncovered_image_srcs: over the 100-README corpus the gap
held 0 of 341 markdown images and 3 HTML ones, which is what made closing it
obviously worth doing.

Image *alt text* is still not covered, and that is now a decision with a number
under it rather than a note. Over the same corpus: 337 images carry alt text,
7,282 characters of it, containing 0 lexicon tells and 18 prose dashes. The 18
cost nothing today, because both counters compare a before to an after and an
editor that leaves alt text alone moves neither. What protecting it verbatim
*would* cost is the legitimate edit: alt text in this corpus is overwhelmingly
badge labels, and "PyPI" becoming "PyPI version" is a fix, not a violation.
SKILL.md's guardrails never promised alt text was untouchable, so requiring it
here would be this file inventing a promise the skill does not make. Everything
else on the list is checked in full.

Usage:
    python3 verify.py original.md rewritten.md
    python3 verify.py original.md rewritten.md --json
    python3 verify.py original.md converted.md --allow-structure

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 a violation, 2 a usage or IO error.

Heading structure is inviolable by default, which is right for `deslop` and
wrong for `voice`: a conversion reorders sections and rewrites headings because
the profile told it to. `--allow-structure` moves those two checks into a
reported `structure_changes` list instead of failing. Nothing else moves with
them, and the default is unchanged.

Carve-outs, because the skill instructs these edits:
  - a heading whose text changed only in capitalization (Title Case fix)
  - a URL that lost only an AI tracking parameter
  - an en dash between digits, which is a numeric range and not a splice
  - a tell or a dash inside a span the skill already promises not to touch:
    code, tables, block quotes, frontmatter, and quoted examples
