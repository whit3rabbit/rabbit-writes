Markdown spans, one definition each.

Everything in this plugin that has to tell prose from markup reads its patterns
from here. Three scripts used to carry their own copies, with comments asking
the next reader to keep them in sync by hand, and the copies drifted anyway:
the badge host lists disagreed, LINK_RX blanked images in one file and not in
another, and two heading patterns matched different spans. A comment is not a
mechanism. This module is.

Blanking, never deleting. Every blank_* and strip_* function here replaces a
span with the same number of characters, so an offset taken from the blanked
copy still points at the same place in the original. Most callers report line
numbers out of a copy they blanked, and preserving length is what makes that
legal. tests/test_invariants.py checks the property rather than trusting the
comment.

Stdlib only, 3.9+.

# newline meant a quotation that moved across a line boundary vanished from
# facts.quoted's multiset and read as a quotation removed. A blank line still
# ends the span, because an unclosed quote mark would otherwise swallow the
# rest of the document up to the 400-character ceiling.
#
# There is no lower bound, and that is the load-bearing half. A straight quote
# closes with the same character it opens with, so pairing is positional: skip
# one well-formed pair and every quote after it on the paragraph pairs with the
# wrong neighbour. A `{4,400}` floor did exactly that. `("No.")` holds three
# characters, fell under the floor, and its *closing* quote then opened a
# 220-character span that ran to the opening quote of the next real quotation
# and ate it, which left `circle back"` scored as prose and raised a banned
# phrase against a document that was only naming the phrase as an example.
# Length is a judgement about a matched span, not about where one ends, so the
# callers that want a floor apply their own: facts.quoted has QUOTED_MIN_WORDS.
# The curly right-single mark closes a quotation and spells an apostrophe, and
# those are the same character. A genuine closing quote is never immediately
# followed by a letter and an apostrophe always is, which is the distinction
# both halves of this fix turn on. `_closer_guard` refuses a "closer" that
# looks like an apostrophe. `_content_class` is the half that also has to
# change: without it, the mark inside "It's" is excluded from content the
# same as a real closer, the greedy match cannot skip past it either way, and
# `'It's a test'` matched nothing at all rather than the whole quotation.
# Letting the mark back into content, but only when a letter follows, keeps
# the positional pairing the module docstring above describes: a mark that is
# NOT followed by a letter still ends the span, exactly as before. Neither
# guard applies to the other two pairs in _QUOTE_PAIRS, and there is no
# straight-single-quote pair here to carry the same problem: `'` is ASCII
# apostrophe and closing quote both, and _QUOTE_PAIRS never pairs it with
