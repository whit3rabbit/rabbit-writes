One finding shape, for every checker in this plugin.

A finding is a dict with exactly these keys:

    id          stable slug. A lexicon pattern id, a voice rule id, or one of
                the synthetic ids in rwlib.lexicon.SYNTHETIC_FINDING_IDS.
    label       one line, for a human, already formatted with any counts.
    band        voice | fingerprint | craft | structure. See BANDS.
    priority    P0 | P1 | P2.
    line        1-indexed line in the file the finding was read from.
    match       the text that triggered it, truncated. Empty, or a short
                stand-in like "3 badges", when the finding is about the whole
                document and no single span caused it.
    excerpt     surrounding text, or the instruction for fixing it. This is the
                second line of a report, and it is where a structural finding
                puts its entire explanation.

readme_check.py used to spell the last one `detail` and drop `match` entirely,
so its reporter had to branch on the band to decide which key held the text and
no downstream consumer could read both checkers with one parser. That is why
SCHEMA_VERSION exists and why it is emitted in --json: a consumer that pins it
finds out at parse time when the shape moves, rather than by rendering blanks.

SCHEMA_VERSION goes up when a key is removed, renamed, or changes meaning.
Adding an optional key does not move it.

Stdlib only, 3.8+.

SCHEMA_VERSION = 1

# Ordered worst-first, which is also the order every reporter prints them in.
PRIORITIES = ("P0", "P1", "P2")

# Ordered by how much the reader is expected to argue with the finding.
#
#   structure    the shape of the document, measured against the corpus.
#   voice        this writer's own rules. A hit is a defect, not a suggestion.
#   fingerprint  evidence about how the text was produced.
#   craft        general writing problems, never evidence about authorship.
