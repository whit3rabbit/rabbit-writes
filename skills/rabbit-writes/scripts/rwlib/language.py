Is this English? A warning, never a gate.

Every calibrated number in this engine is calibrated on English. The tier lists
are English words, the contraction and abbreviation rules are English
orthography, the sentence splitter breaks on English terminal punctuation, and
the burstiness and type-token bands come from studies of English prose. Run it
over Japanese or Arabic and it will still print numbers. They will not mean
anything.

So the tool says so. It does not refuse: a bilingual README with an English
quickstart is a real document that deserves a real answer for the English half,
and a checker that hard-fails on a Chinese heading is a checker people delete
from CI. The rule this module implements is: flag, do not fail.

The measure is the share of letters that are ASCII. That is a coarse instrument
and it is chosen on purpose over anything cleverer. It cannot tell English from
French, it counts a transliterated name against you, and it has nothing to say
about a document that is mostly numbers. What it does reliably is notice a
non-Latin script, which is the case where the output is worthless rather than
merely imprecise, and being wrong about French costs a note nobody has to act
on.

Stdlib only, 3.8+.
