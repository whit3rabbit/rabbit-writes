attain.py - did the conversion land?

`verify.py` answers "did the rewrite break anything". Nothing answered "did it
arrive", and SKILL.md names the gap in prose three separate times: a pass that
cleared eleven mechanical hits, moved the punctuation, and left the register
alone. That is the commonest failure of a voice conversion and no rule-by-rule
report can see it, because every rule passed.

This reads the two documents, measures both against the profile's fingerprint,
and says which of the six measures moved toward it, which missed, and which
went the wrong way.

    python3 attain.py before.md after.md --voice whit3rabbit
    python3 attain.py after.md --voice auto            # no before column
    python3 attain.py before.md after.md --json --check
    python3 attain.py before.md --voice dana --plan    # the shape to write to

Why a script of its own, rather than a flag on one of the two that exist:

  Not `verify.py`. Its `ok` key gates whether `scan.py --apply-safe --write`
  writes at all. Putting a register measurement in there lets a distance stop
  the mechanical fixer, which is the humanizer-shaped failure the whole P2 rule
  exists to prevent.

  Not `scan.py`. Attainment is a two-document question, and that CLI is one
  document with many views. It already juggles stdin, --apply-safe, --write,
  --stdout and --sarif, and a second input path collides with all of them.

**Exit codes, and the rule behind them.** A number about a *document* never
blocks. A number about an *edit* may. `scan.py`'s `voice-distance` is P2 forever
and cannot fail `--check`, because the `rabbit-scan` hook runs it in a
stranger's repository over a document nobody asked to convert. This is
different: you ran it, on a pair, naming a profile, after asking for a
conversion. So:

    0   every verdict, with no flags. The opposite of verify.py's default.
    1   only with --check, and only on `regressed` and `flat`. Never on
        `partial` or `missed`, which mean the document cannot reach the target
        without inventing content, and guardrail 1 forbids that.
    2   an IO error, a profile named by hand that will not read, or a resolved
        profile with no fingerprint.

That last one diverges from scan.py deliberately. There, a missing fingerprint
is the common case and a note. Here you asked for an attainment check, and a
clean report over nothing measured is a false pass.

No pre-commit hook ships for this. `check_precommit_hooks` in scripts/validate.py
fails one that names this script unless it is opt-in and voice-scoped.
